# Open for Collaborations

I am open to collaborators who would like to contribute and improve this project.
If you are interested in working on this, please contact me and I will add you as a collaborator on GitHub.

### Features I would like help with:

* **High-quality PDF export** – improve the current PDF generation, which is not optimal.
* **Offline executable (.exe) version** – package the app into a desktop application with local saving functionality.



**_Please DM me if you are interested in taking this project further._**
